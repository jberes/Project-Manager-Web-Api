# Project Manager Web API Example

This is the Web API code for the webinar on Oct 12, 20222 demonstrating EF Core Power Tools, SQL Server and App Builder with Ignite UI Angular to build a simple CRUD app in Angular. Use Visual Studio 2022 to run this sample, but make sure to create your SQL / SQL Express database with this script first - https://github.com/jberes/Project-Manager-Web-Api/blob/master/ProjectTasksDb.txt - and add your connection string to the appsettings in the Visual Studio project.

Try App Builder for yourself at https://appbuilder.indigo.design/ and learn more at https://www.infragistics.com/products/appbuilder.
